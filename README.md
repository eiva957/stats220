# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in data programming
- I am interested in learning about how large data is used and worked with in a programming context

### My uni degree:

* I am studying *computer science*
* I am in my **final semester**
* My favourite language I have learnt so far is [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
